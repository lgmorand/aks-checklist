      "detail": "Network policy is a Kubernetes feature that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You can choose to allow or deny traffic based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. The use of network policies gives a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, the required network policies can be automatically applied. Don't use Azure network security groups to control pod-to-pod traffic, use network policies.",
